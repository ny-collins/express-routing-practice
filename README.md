# Express Routing Practice

This is a basic project to practice routing using **Express.js**, a popular web framework for Node.js. The goal is to gain hands-on experience working with different types of HTTP routes, parameters, and middleware.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - For handling your repositories.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - This is one of the most popular IDE's, but you can use any other, or any code editor.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

### Running the Server

```bash
node index.js
```

The server will start on `localhost:3000` (unless specified otherwise in the code. For my code, I specified Port 3001).
